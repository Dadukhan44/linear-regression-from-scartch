Linear Regression is one of the simplest and most popular machine learning algorithms.
It finds a straight-line relationship between input features (X) and the target (Y).
In simple terms, it tries to draw the best-fitting line through the data points to make predictions.

Use cases: predicting prices, trends, sales, or any continuous value

Formula: Y = mX + c (for single feature)

Goal: minimize the error between actual and predicted values
